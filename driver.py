# Your job in this assignment is to write driver.py, which solves any 8-puzzle board when given an
# arbitrary starting configuration. The program will be executed as follows:
#
# $ python driver.py <method> <board>
#
# The method argument will be one of the following. You need to implement all three of them:
#
# bfs (Breadth-First Search)
#
# dfs (Depth-First Search)
#
# ast (A-Star Search)
#
# The board argument will be a comma-separated list of integers containing no spaces.
# For example, to use the bread-first search strategy to solve the input board
# given by the starting configuration {0,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1},
# the program will be executed like so (with no spaces between commas):
#
# $ python driver.py bfs 0,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
#
